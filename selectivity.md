# A comment on selectivity versus open access

Point 4 in the article says this: 

"when a hiring committee examines a junior scientist’s CV, a publication in a traditional journal carries with it the weight associated with the journal’s reputation for selectivity, rigor, novelty, and yes, likely impact. On the surface, a publication in an open-access journal only imparts ‘not scientifically flawed"

This conflates open-access with non-selectivity, which is incorrect. Many (how many? need data) open access journals have rigorous selection procedures that are very similar to those of more traditional print journals. We appreciate that hiring committees will often use information on the journal in which a paper is published to judge a scientists track record. To assist with this process, we have compiled a table of popular open access journals in ecology and evolution, noting whether or not they are selective, along with their 2013 impact factors (see .csv file).
