# A comment on selectivity versus open access

Point 4 in the article says this: 

"when a hiring committee examines a junior scientist’s CV, a publication in a traditional journal carries with it the weight associated with the journal’s reputation for selectivity, rigor, novelty, and yes, likely impact. On the surface, a publication in an open-access journal only imparts ‘not scientifically flawed"

Here's some suggested text

Agrawal's letter contains many interesting points. However, he makes the mistake of conflating open-access journals with non-selective journals when he states that "On the surface, a publication in an open-access journal only imparts ‘not scientifically flawed'" (in his point 4). Suggesting that no open access journals are selective is incorrect. While this is true of some open access journals (e.g. PLoS ONE), many (how many? need data) others have selection procedures as rigorous as those of traditional print journals (Table x).

We agree with Agrawal that judgements of scientist's track records often include consideration of the journals in which they have published. Because of this, it is beholden on all of us to be aware of journals' publishing policies, as the field is rapidly changing away from exclusively print journals. To assist with this, and in particular to illustrate that many open access journals are highly selective in what they publish, we have compiled a list of the publication policies of popular open access journals in ecology and evolution (Table 1). This list is also available at (somewhere online like FigShare).
