# A comment on selectivity versus open access

Point 4 in the article says this: 

"when a hiring committee examines a junior scientist’s CV, a publication in a traditional journal carries with it the weight associated with the journal’s reputation for selectivity, rigor, novelty, and yes, likely impact. On the surface, a publication in an open-access journal only imparts ‘not scientifically flawed"

Here's some suggested text

Agrawal's letter contains many interesting points. However, he incorrectly conflates open-access journals with non-selective journals when he states in in his point iv that "a publication in an open-access journal only imparts [only that a given paper is] ‘not scientifically flawed'". Suggesting open access journals are not selective is incorrect. While this is true of some open access journals (e.g. PLoS ONE), many (how many? need data) others have selection procedures as rigorous as those of traditional print journals (Table x).

We, sadly, agree with Agrawal that scientists are often judged based on the journals in which they have published. Because of this, it is beholden on all of us to be aware of the information that publishing in a given journal might convey, particularly as Ecology and Evolution shift rapidly away from publishing in exclusively close-access print journals. To assist with this, and in particular to illustrate that many open access journals are highly selective, we have compiled a list of the publication policies of popular open access journals in ecology and evolution (Table 1). This list is also available at (somewhere online like FigShare, or maybe Wikipedia would be better, so that it can get continually updated as policies change an new journals appear).
