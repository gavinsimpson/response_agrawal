One to two ยง of introduction (what the original paper is about)

**Point 1**

We feel that the first point, "know your publisher's business model", is
making a confusion between *predatory* open access publishers (which are
well identified, {link}), and the general open access movement. Turning in
a profit has never been impossible to reconcile with providing outstanding
service to the scientific community; it is indeed the entire business model
of society operated journals. In addition, many OA journals offer either
waivers for scientists from low-income countries, or *no questions asked*
waivers for scientists waiting to publish under the OA model but lacking
funding. Newer initatives, such as *PeerJ*, use a lifetime membership instead
of per article charges, bringing the *total* cost of publishing OA papers
in the low double digits. Virtually all publishers profit from the work of
scientists, whether this happens at the journal level (as is often the case
for non-predatory OA), the society level, or through a corporation managing
a large portfolio of journals and strictly enforcing copyright.

Conclusion: what is important for scientists (benefiting many people vs. narcissism of individual impact)
