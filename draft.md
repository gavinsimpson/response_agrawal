One to two ยง of introduction (what the original paper is about)

A point: there is a confusion between OA journals, the OA model, and predatory
publishing. We should think about a paragraph to clear things up.

**Point 1**

We feel that the first point, "know your publisher's business model", is
making a confusion between *predatory* open access publishers (which are
well identified, {link}), and the general open access movement. Turning in
a profit has never been impossible to reconcile with providing outstanding
service to the scientific community; it is indeed the entire business model
of society operated journals. In addition, many OA journals offer either
waivers for scientists from low-income countries, or *no questions asked*
waivers for scientists waiting to publish under the OA model but lacking
funding. Newer initatives, such as *PeerJ*, use a lifetime membership instead
of per article charges, bringing the *total* cost of publishing OA papers
in the low double digits. Virtually all publishers profit from the work of
scientists, whether this happens at the journal level (as is often the case
for non-predatory OA), the society level, or through a corporation managing
a large portfolio of journals and strictly enforcing copyright.

**Point 2**

It's true that, as a cost-saving measure, many pure-OA journals do not
copyedit the papers they receive (although this is not a general truth;
journals like *Ecology & Evolution*, *F1000Research*, and *PeerJ* practice
copyediting). Yet many mixed-models OA offer the same quality of service to
authors, regardless of whether they choose an OA licence or not for their
article. On the other hand, we question the validity of figures modification
as a relevant argument. Except for a handful of high-profile publications,
most journals do not alter the figures at all.

**Point 3**

**Point 4**

Conclusion: what is important for scientists (benefiting many people vs. narcissism of individual impact)
