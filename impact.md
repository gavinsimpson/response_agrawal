Main point of the paper: OA journals / papers are not necessarily lower impact, need to move towards article-level metrics anyway

**Points 3/4**: OA papers are not cited more (easy to find papers saying the opposite), and some people consider IF as a surrogate of paper quality

Most of the arguments Agrawal raises against OA for early career scientists
(point iii and iv) fall into two broad categories. First, the impact factor of
OA journals is not higher than the impact factor of non-OA journals. Second,
it is tempting to use the journal as a surrogate for the quality of a paper,
and less prestigious OA journals run a risk of seeing good papers viewed
less favorably. We do not think that any of these points are valid arguments against open access.

First, the distinction between OA and non-OA journals is a false
dichotomy. Although there are journals applying an open access (often of the
*Creative Commons* variety) to all articles they publish, an increasing number
of publishers allow authors to pay a *per* article OA license to retain their
copyright, and so there exists a continuum between pure-OA, mixed-models,
and closed journals. Even though, the notion that pure-OA journals have
a lower impact is challenged by some. James Pringle of Thomson ISI* (i)
recognizes that the relevance of journals when talking about OA is dubious
and (ii) "prospective authors should not fear publishing in these journals"

Conclusion: what is important for scientists (benefiting many people vs. narcissism of individual impact)
